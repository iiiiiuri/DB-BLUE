# What it he's does?
* Hey everyone! I'm here to talk about my project, **DB-BLUE**. It's something I'm working on to improve my skills and knowledge, I'm using Django.

* The principal function of the project is, storage archives in the databases like a ![Google Drive](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Drive-4285F4?style=for-the-badge&logo=googledrive&logoColor=white) or  ![OneDrive](https://img.shields.io/badge/OneDrive-0078D4.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoftonedrive&logoColor=white) . The archives maybe a picture, codes, text, and videos.

* You know why I went with Django? Because it is one of the best web frameworks, very sturdy and capable of managing projects of all sizes. As I add new features and ideas to DB-BLUE, Django helps me expand the project seamlessly.

# Attention!
Oh, just to make it clear: DB-BLUE is a **study project** , okay? It's not for professional use or anything like that. I'm focused on improving its functionalities and delivering a cool experience, but it's not meant for production or making money, but, after in the future i wanna transform this project in a method of business for me.
So, there you have it! I'm excited to keep working on DB-BLUE, exploring all the possibilities that Django has to offer.



* Get ready for a revamped experience with DB-BLUE! Now, with Python and the powerful **Django** Framework as our main technologies, we're taking our project to the next level.

# How i test this code?
